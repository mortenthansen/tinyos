The AckDataTest application tests the DataAckLayer of rfxlink.  This
layer is an alternative to the SoftwareAckLayer which enables a user
to embed data into ACKs.  In order to conform to the IEEE 15.4
standard these data ACKs cannot have type ACK and are instead sent as
data packets without addressing information.  The fact that they are
sent without addressing information enables the Ieee154PacketLayerP to
distinguish between these data ACKs and a regular data packet.
