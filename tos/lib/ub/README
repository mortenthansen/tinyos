A Unified Broadcast (UB) layer for TinyOS 2.x.  It hooks into the AM stack
by modifying three core files:

  - DirectAMSenderC.nc: where the UB layer is inserted as a layer in the send stack
	- AMReceiveC.nc: where the UB layer is inserted as a layer in the receive stack
  - AMSenderC.nc, DirectAMSenderC.nc, and LplAMSenderC.nc: to provide the UnifiedBroadcast
    interface to the sending protocol.

UB delays and combines broadcasts at the sending side, in order to
save on the number of broadcasts sent.  The combined broadcasts are
seperated at the receiver and delivered to the according protocol as
normal.

UB delays can be disabled per sender through the UnifiedBroadcast
interface.  Note that disabling any delay for a protocol is not the
same as sending the protocols broadcast without UB as they can still
be combined with already delayed broadcasts.
